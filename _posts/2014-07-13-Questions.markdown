###From [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1986386/check-if-value-exists-in-array-in-ruby?rq=1): If I have a value 'Dog' and an array ['Cat', 'Dog', 'Bird'], how do I check this w/o looping through. Is there a simple way of checking if the value exists, nothing more?

Asking good questions is an important part of the learning. The ability to ask good questions can save many hours of frustration and unproductive mental wanderings.

In this question from stackoverflow, the questioner provides a great example of a simple, well-constructed question. The header provides a good one-line summary of the problem and indicates the specific programming language related to his query. He also provides a specific constraint to his question, namely, that he is only interested in knowing if there is a way of checking whether a value is present without simply looping through each value of his array. Unexpectedly, many of the responses to his query mention Ruby's Array#include? and Set#include? method. 

The asker in this case could have improved this question by providing more information about why he would like this question answered and under what circumstances it would be preferable for him to search for a value in an array without looping. That information could provide better insight what sort of information would be most useful and what sorts of solution would be best suited to his situation.
