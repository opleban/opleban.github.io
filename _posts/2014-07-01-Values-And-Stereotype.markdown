###Values

Achievement, ambition, merit, self-reliance, accountability, recognition, effectivness and persistence.

If I had to whittle down this list of values, even further, I could probably settle with self-reliance and persistence. While I definitely do understand theimportance of more outward looking values such as community, family, and friendship, after spending two years living in a rural village in Morocco, I have a much keener appreciation for the more individual-oriented values. I learned to be more self-reliant in ensuring my needs were met under adverse conditions. Persistence and self-reliance enabled me to be more adventurous and ambitious in pursuing my objectives.

###Stereotype Threat

I think its extremely important in general to be self-aware of your internal emotional state. Particularly, when you feel threatened by others in a significant way.  The stereotype threat is particularly pernicious since it plays upon sometimes unacknowledged biases and prejudces and hence can be difficult to recognize both by the offender and victim of the stereotype. Overall, awareness of the stereotype threat can only help in mediating it by providing an opportunity for you to communicate your discomfort in an appropriate and effective way to those around you.
