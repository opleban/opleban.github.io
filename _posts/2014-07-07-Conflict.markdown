During one of my college internship out in California, I had a professional conflict with a colleague that later turned into a personal conflict. At the time, I was working as an intern at a political consulting firm, and I was still rather inexperienced in dealing with workplace dynamics. I hadn't spent much time in a profesional setting at that point in my career and had very little experience taking or giving constructive criticism. As a result, what started as a relatively insignificant squabble over a minor part of a minor project quickly ballooned into a very cool and unproductive working relationship with my colleague.

If I could go back and do things differently, I would have been much more forthright in trying to settle the professional disagreement much more promptly and would have worked much more earnestly to address the personal discontent that lingered between us afterwards. From this experience, I learned the importance clear and polite communication and moreover have a much greater appreciation for pleasant, professional and productive working relationships with my work colleagues.
