##What is JavaScript?

JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language and the main scripting language used in web browsers. JavaScript was originally created for Netscape 2 back in 1996 and not much later gained supported by Microsoft in Internet Explorer 3.0. It is now the de facto king of scripting language used in all major web browsers. Part of its main appeal and the impetus for its development is JavaScript's client-side scripting. As opposed slower server-side scripting, it allows for more responsive, dynamic webpages that quickly react to user inputs by allowing processing to occur locally within the web browser rather than remotely on the server.

##Quantity over Quality

Questions of quality seem beside the point when talking about the popularity of JavaScript. JavaScript works. Instead, it's popularity seems to be a great case-study of the network effect. It's ubiquity across all internet-accessible media device, means that any developer wanting to create a product that can be accessed by the largest possible market segment will naturally gravitate towards JavaScript. Qualitative questions seem almost irrelevant. My very unscientific (read: haphazard) assessment of the tech blogosphere's consensus regarding JavaScript indicates: Technical users don't seem particularly happy about JavaScript, but they don't seem overly miserable with it either. Non-technical users gravitate towards content mostly agnostic to the underlying technology. Hence, the status quo prevails.
