Notes on My Blog
	Big Image files take a while to load
	Not smooth
	Design feels a bit off, I like the cartoon-ish look but not necessarily professional 
	My name is a little too prominently featured, arrogant?
	No mention of my tech experience
	No contact information or way of contacting me
	No link to my resume/linkedIn profile
	Too many pictures/colors, distracting
	Blog post content is sub-par, need to edit my previous posts
	Need to include dates for each post

	Need contact information
