  <h3> In the beginning... </h3>
  <p> My name is <em>Ori Jonathan Pleban</em>. I was born and raised in the Central Valley of California. Eager to leave the area, I headed out east to Philadelphia where I did my undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania. </p>

  <p> After graduating college, I joined the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/" title="Peace Corps Website" target="_blank">Peace Corps</a> and spent the last two years in <b>Morocco</b> living in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/Y5X1z" title="Google Maps">a small mountain village</a> nestled in the Middle Atlas Mountains. During my time in Morocco, I saw how technology and internet were affecting peoples lives in even the most <span class="exotic">rural parts of the countries. </span>
