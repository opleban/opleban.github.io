		<p> I am immensely excited to start Dev Bootcamp in July. I will admit to some initial anxiety over my relative lack of experience with programming world. However, hearing Shereef discuss the Dev Bootcamp experience and his philosophy allays some of my fears about jumping into the deep-end of web development.</p>
		<p>I apologise in advance for those of you that will get to know me and my near constant reference to Morocco and my Peace Corps experience. Nonetheless, what struck me about Shereef account of Dev Bootcamp, was how resonant it was with my Peace Corps experience. In many ways, Dev Bootcamp seems to be the Peace Corps pre-service training on steroids. Not only are we expected to learn a new language (as we do in Peace Corps), but a whole new way of interacting with our adoptive community. Moreover, both programs have an emphasis on effective communication and collaboration. Only, maybe this is where the analogy falls apart, instead of being sent to rural reaches of Morocco, I'm instead heading into the techie heart of the Bay Area!</p>
