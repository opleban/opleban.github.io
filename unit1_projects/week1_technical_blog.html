	<h4>Introductory thoughts</h4>
	<p>Oh, how times have changed! Had I written this blog a year ago, the only website on this list would have been <a href="http://www.tastespotting.com/" target="_blank">TasteSpotting</a>, A reflection of my very (un)healthy interest in food. While I still like to go tastespotting on occasion, my web-surfing habits have changed since then.</p>

	<p>As a recovering politico and minor news junkie, my choice of sites is a reflection of my current interests and day-to-day experience working in a politics. My three sites that I'll discuss below are Slate, Digg and Hype Machine. The first two definitely reflect my interest in political commentary and current events, while Hype Machine reflects the fact that I usually like to work with interesting music streaming in the background.</p>

	<h4>Notes on Ghostery</h4>

	<p>In general when I surf the web, I utilize <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/en/" target="_blank">Ghostery</a> an add-on to Chrome that lets you block most cookies and web trackers and also has the effect of blocking many banner and pop-up advertisement. While with Digg, this made little difference in my browsing experience, with Slate and Hype Machine, I definitely did notice the difference in the amount and placement of advertisements across the website. With that in mind, I made sure to disable Ghostery in order to give a better idea of what the ordinary user experience is for these websites.</p>

	<a href="http://www.slate.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Slate</h3></a>

	<p>Slate is an online news magazine that provides left-of-center, occasionally contrarian commentary on current events, politics and culture. Slate commentators provide an interesting take on the news and current events although not quite in the way that newer outfits like "<a href="http://www.vox.com/" target="_blank">Vox</a>" or Glenn Greenwald's "<a href="https://firstlook.org/theintercept/" target="_blank">The Intercept</a>" which seem much more overt in their mission to <i>“educate”</i> and <i>“inform”</i> the public a-la <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zabb3fxGTPk" target="_blank">Will McAvoy</a>. Rather, Slate seems to assume a certain political savviness on the part of its readers.</p>

	<div class="post_img"><a href="images/slate_snapshot.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/slate_snapshot.png"/></a><div class="img_caption">Slate homepage</div></div>

	<ul><b><u>The Look</u></b>
		<li>minimalist</li>
		<li>modern</li>
		<li>clean</li>
		<li>bright</li>
		<li>square</li>
	</ul>

<p>Slate's look as implied by its name seems meant to evoke a slate of rock. Very square and clean looking. Slate is layed out over a three main columns. Slate draws attention to the main articles by making those articles appear higher up on the webpage and has them take up greater space across an entire column, while the minor articles are given subcolumns and generally lower on the page. </p>
	<ul><b><u>The Content</u></b>
		<li>left-of-center</li>
		<li>political</li>
		<li>current</li>
		<li>serious</li>
		<li>contrarian</li>
	</ul>

<p>While the website’s layout is relatively simple, the website designers seem more intent on organizing the content by its timeliness and click-worthiness rather than categorically by topic. Hence, the front page will often feature a wide range of topics from sports to political primaries, ensuring that there is something for everyone. In keeping with their emphasis on timeliness, there are in fact two sections geared around late-breaking or new news items with a section punned “Slatest” and another section "Most Recent". The modern and clean look of Slate complements its focus on serious commentary. The use of negative space to define borders between the articles on the site conceptually complements Slate's contrarian political tendencies.</p>

<p>The website doesn’t necessarily make me want to stay on it for a long time. Instead I’m more inclined to want to click through and read quickly through the easily digestible articles. Slate focus isn’t on long-form journalism but is more for people with short attention-spans. It’s longest articles tend to be at most two to three pages.</p>

<p>The website has “sponsored content” that is clearly distinguished as such, with a teal border surrounding it. They also have a Slate store that sells branded items such as shirts and coffee mugs. Slate also offers "<a href="http://www.slate.com/plus?wpsrc=sp_all_hp-rr_promo" target="_blank">Slate Plus</a>". So called because it provides access, for those willing to pay $5 a month or $50 a year, to extra content. This includes exclusive access Slate commentators and behind-the-scene style articles providing more insight into the news making process. They also provide an “enhanced on-site experience”. This basically sounds like features otherwise meant to boost site statistics that otherwise annoy the ordinary reader such as articles split over multiple pages rather than on a single page, or the ability to view comments in page rather than in a pop-up window. In general, I tend to be thrifty in my spending habits and don't find the prospective of an "enhanced experience" or extra content value enough to justify spending the extra money. I find the content provided to be sufficient for my needs.</p>

<a href="http://www.digg.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Digg</h3></a>

<p>Digg became a mainstay of mine relatively recently. Being a micromanager when it comes to my news consumption (as well as my music, see Hype Machine below), I used to be a heavy user of Google Reader as an RSS feed aggregator to keep track of my various political and world events blogs. Google eventually ceased support for Reader in July 2013. At that point, in my search for an alternative I turned to Digg’s Reader, which featured an interface that was very similar to Google Reader .  Eventually, I ceased using Digg’s Reader and now visit the site multiple times a day for the editor-curated articles featured on their front page.</p>


	<div class="post_img"><a href="images/digg_snapshot.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/digg_snapshot.png"/ alt="Digg homepage"></a><div class="img_caption">Digg homepage</div></div>

	<ul><b><u>The Look</u></b>
		<li>minimalist</li>
		<li>retro</li>
		<li>uniform</li>
		<li>eye-catching</li>
		<li>simple</li>
	</ul>

<p>Digg used to be a community-driven website very similar to Reddit where users would vote for content they wanted to appear on the front page by either choosing to "dig" or "bury" articles. However, unlike Reddit, Digg didn’t survive in that form to this day and is an entirely beast than it was before 2008 when it was sold to its current owners. In its current form, the Digg experience is entirely curated by the editorial staff. Moreover, recently, Digg made a push towards content creation and features “Digg Original" <a href="http://digg.com/originals/why-audio-never-goes-viral" target="_blank">exclusive</a> <a href="http://digg.com/2014/how-to-dispose-of-everything" target="_blank">content</a> on its front page on occasion. This suggests that in the future Digg sees itself not just as an aggregator but also as a content creator similar to <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/" target="_blank">BuzzFeed</a> or the <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/" target="_blank">Huffington Post</a>.</p>

	<ul><b><u>The Content</u></b>
		<li>techie</li>
		<li>metanews</li>
		<li>educational</li>
		<li>novel</li>
		<li>current</li>
	</ul>

</p>Digg provides links to interesting content across the website for those that aren’t otherwise inclined to go out searching for interesting content. While I once took pride in the effort I took in curating my own blogroll of interesting news sources, I’m not sure my news consumption is significantly less interesting or less timely since I’ve taken a back seat and allowed the Digg editors greater control over what I see on a day-to-day basis. I’d say in general, Digg is works for me because it takes the effort out of searching for novelty on the web. Digg provides a good mix of buzz worthy, conventional content and more esoteric or otherwise obscure articles and videos. All of the content is very simply laid out as a grid across the front page. The mostly external link open up in a new window instead you easily to return to Digg afterwards. Even more so than Slate, Digg casts its net wide providing links to external content covering everything from Beyonce's latest release to an article about pictures of goats in sweaters from <a href="http://modernfarmer.com/2013/11/goats-sweaters/" target="_blank">Modern Farmer</a>.</p> 

<p>Digg is definitely one of those sites that you can spend half an hour on without noticing it. Although for the most part, you spend only relatively brief moment on Digg itself and most of the time browsing through the external content it links to. Like Slate, Digg also features clearly marked “sponsored” articles. However, aside from the occasional sponsored content, Digg doesn’t really seem to have any other obvious source of revenue.</p>

<a href="http://www.hypem.com/" target="_blank"><h3>Hype Machine</h3></a>

<p>Hype Machine used to be a great website for finding new music, and it still is, but its real strength in mind is for finding great remixes and interesting covers of songs I already know. This shift is a reflection of the music blogging community as a whole, since Hype Machine is a music blog aggregator. Hype Machine provides a central location for discovering interesting tracks from across the entire music blog community on the internet.  What I thoroughly enjoy about the Hype Machine experience as a music discovery service, is that it isn’t a passive activity like listening to the radio or online streaming services like Rdio or Pandora. Rather, Hype Machine requires some active effort or direction on my part, which elicits a much keener sense of satisfaction when I do find something noteworthy.  Moreover, when I do find a music track that I enjoy, I can follow the link back to the blog which originally posted it to see what else the blog author had posted in the past. So Hype Machine acts not only to help me find new music but also as a blog discovery service. That being said, Hype Machine also has certain passive experiences for when I just want music on the background and I don't want to spend too much time searching it out. Hype Machine allows you to cycle through a playlist of the most popular tracks, or look at just the newest tracks.</p>

	<div class="post_img"><a href="images/hypem_snapshot.png" target="_blank"><img src="images/hypem_snapshot.png"/ alt="Hype Machine homepage"></a><div class="img_caption">Hype Machine homepage</div></div>

<p>Looking at the front page, its clear that my eye supposed to be instantly drawn to banner advertisement featured very prominently right under the Hype Machine logo and menu bar.  However, I previously mentioned, when I turn on Ghostery, the banner advertisement and other flash elements are no longer present and my eye is instead drawn directly to the “latest blogged music” section.</p>

<p>Hype Machine has a very tangible user interface. Just about every element on in it is responsive. It really does evoke a “machine” with its various moving cogs. Navigating the site with my cursor, ever element reacts instantly to my cursor passing over it.  From what little I know now about HTML/CSS, I can imagine the liberal use of pseudoclasses such as ":hover" in CSS source code.</p>
