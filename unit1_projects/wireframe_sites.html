	<h3>Slate</h3>
	<p> Slate aims to provide insightful commentary on current events, pop culture, and sports. Slate aims to be 21st century equivalent of the 20th century magazine. In terms of design, Slate aims to be exprienced on a wide range of devices and hence needs to be easy to navigate on everything from a desktop computer, tablet to an iphone.</p>

	<h3>Digg</h3>
	<p>Digg has very similar aims to  Slate, although its history as a Reddit-like website, gives it a slightly different approach. Digg is a content aggregator that is beginning to dabble in content creation, whereas Slate is a content creator that only links to other content within the context of adding its own commentary. In terms of its design challenges. Digg has a relatively simple and predictable design. It is essential laid out on a three-column grid with one main article taking up the entire first row. </p>

	<h3>Hype Machine</h3>

	<p>Hype Machine is much different than both Slate and Digg. Hype Machine provides the solution to music and music blog discovery on the internet. With such a plethora of music blogs scattered across the internet, Hype Machine provides aggregate information of the online music blog landscape. In terms of visual challenges, Hype Machine needs grapples with presenting the sheer number of music uploaded each day in a meaningful way. Hence, it does that in a list format and allows you to organize the music using a variety of filters, whether by popularity, date, genre, or author. </p>
