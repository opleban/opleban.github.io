			<h3>Stereotype Threat</h3>
			<article>
				<p>In general, after reading Claude Steele's article from the Atlantic, Thin Ice, I did feel a sinking sense of recognition at a lot of the experiences described. And I can definitely relate to the feeling of intellectual disengagement stemming from aversion to further disappointment or fear of social rejection.

				<p>Growing up and during my short stint in adulthood, I've never faced much of the stereotype threat for anything regarding my academic performance.  However, having always been on the shorter-side of height spectrum, I was somewhat less fortunate when it came to sports. One sport in partiuclar stands out -little league baseball. Without going into too much detail, the story is not very interesting, the experience was less than pleasant and it discouraged me from playing other sports in school until much later in high school.</p>

				<p>I'm working on preparing myself beforehand to ensure that I am both supportive of others and myself going into DBC. Importantly, I need to make sure to place greater scrutiny over my own possibly unacknowledged biases and prejudices towards others.</p>
