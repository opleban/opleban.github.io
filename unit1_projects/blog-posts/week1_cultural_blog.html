			<h3>Cultural Blog: Fireside Chat</h3>
			<article>
				<p> I am immensely excited to start Dev Bootcamp in July. I will admit to some initial anxiety over my relative lack of experience with programming. However, after hearing Shereef discuss the Dev Bootcamp experience and his philosophy, I'm definitely excited to jump into the deep-end of web development.</p>
				<p>I'll apologise in advance for those of you that will get to know me and be victim to my near constant references to Morocco and my Peace Corps experience. Nonetheless, what struck me about Shereef's account of the Dev Bootcamp experience, was how much it resonated with my Peace Corps experience. In many ways, Dev Bootcamp seems to be the Peace Corps pre-service training on steroids. Not only are we expected to learn a new language (as we do in Peace Corps), but a whole new way of interacting with our adoptive community. Moreover, both programs have an emphasis on effective communication and collaboration. Only, maybe this is where the analogy falls apart, instead of being sent to rural reaches of conservative Morocco, I'll instead embark into the techie heart of the Bay Area!</p> 
				<p> I'm looking forward to meeting and collaborating with everyone over the next three months!</p>
			
				<p>Cheers, <br/>
