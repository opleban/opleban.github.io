			<h3>Pairing and Feedback</h3>
			<article>
				<h4>Pairing</h4>
				<p>I always feel a certain sense of nervousness before each pairing session. Working on any challenge as a pair, or any other group setting adds an extra layer of complexity. Not only do I need to concentrate on solving the challenge, but I also need to communicate my inner thought processes to my partner. Sometimes, I feel like that latter task gets in the way of the first task. I spend too much time trying to clearly communicate with my partner and not enough time thinking critically about how to approach the problems. It also inhibits my usual process of trial and error and willingness to experiment with methods or approaches that I may not yet feel completely comfortable with for fear of embarassment.</p>

				<p>On the other hand, working with someone else provides a variety of benefits as well. I'm exposed to different ways of approaching a problem than I would otherwise take on my own. The back and forth discussion with my partner on basic concepts, also provides an opportunity to clarify my understanding of them, both in circumstances where I am able to explain a concept to my partner, and when I am the one that can benefit from clarification.  The most important benefit, in my mind, is that pairing with someone else, having another set of eyes, forces me to follow best practices when approaching the coding challenges. On my own, I may be tempted to jump straight into coding or testing out approaches in IRB, whereas when I'm pairing with someone else, I need to write good pseudocode before starting to write code so that both of us know the general outline of what the code will eventually look like.</p>

				<h4>Feedback</h4>
				<p>I wholly understand that receiving feedback is a very important part of the learning process. Feedback is a large part of why I chose to attend Dev Bootcamp over studying on my own or signing up for an online only program. I wanted to be in an environment where I could receive a sense of my progress and quickly be able to solve any problems that may arise through constructive feedback. Thankfully, the feedback I have received so far has been mostly positive, but I definitely want to be prepared for when I do receive negative feedback so that I know how to properly process the feedback and make any necessary corrections.</p>

				<p>The most difficult part of feedback for me has been providing constructive feedback to others. All of my pairing sessions so far have been positive, so I haven't been in a position yet where I have been forced to give negative constructive feedback. But I do have some anxiety nonetheless, about needing to provide feedback to others in situations where not everything was copacetic.  That being said, being able to read and provide feedback to others on their feedback (very meta!), has been a great opportunity for me to exercise my feedback-giving muscles.</p>

				<p>Overall, although it does cause me a certain sense of anxiety, I appreciate the opportunity to work with others and look forward to being able to pair with people in person rather than just over Google Hangout.</p>
