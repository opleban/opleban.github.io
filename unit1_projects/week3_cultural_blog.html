				<p>I'm an abstract random thinker. I flourish in a personalized, non-competitive learning environment and bristle under the yoke of authoritarian and dictatorial personalities. Sounds like abstract random thinkers are the main constituents of socialist communes. That being said, I take the conclusions drawn regarding abstract random thinkers with a grain of salt. While I certainly do see many of those characteristics in myself, I also know that I enjoy a healthy sense of competition. Like Concrete Sequential thinkers, I enjoy having a structured learning environment and take some solace when faced with a predictable situation.</p> 

				<p>Nonetheless, whether or not I'm more Abstract Random or Concrete Sequential curious, is besides the point. My focus instead is on presenting the best version to flourish in an intensive learning environment. Already, I find myself lacking in certain respects when it comes to my approach to Phase 0 material. I find myself cherry-picking the easy material and leaving the more difficult material behind. Later on, when all of the low-hanging challenges have been picked, I find my progress frustrated by a series of difficult tasks that completely blunt any mental momentum I may have built up before.</p>

				<p>I am actively working on becoming better disciplined at tackling my tasks by their conceptual groupings rather than based on their ease of completion. This ties in very well with the concept of growth vs. fixed mindset. I need to start facing difficult tasks head-on and embrace these exertions as worth struggling over and learning from, rather than avoiding them and putting them off indefinitely. I need to accept failures less as validation of inadequacies and more as opportunities for growth that at the very least leave me no worse for the wear</p>
