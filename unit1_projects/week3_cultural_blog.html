				<p>I'm an abstract random thinker. I flourish in a personalized, non-competitive learning environment and bristle under the yoke of authoritarian and dictatorial personalities. Sounds like abstract random thinkers are the main constituents of socialist communes. That being said, I take the conclusions drawn regarding abstract random thinkers with a grain of salt. While I certainly do see many of those characterstics in myself, I also know for example that I can be very competitive and like Concrete Sequential thinkers, I enjoy having a structured learning environment and take some solace when faced with a predictable situation.</p> 

				<p>Nonethless, whether or not I'm more Abstract Random than I am Concrete Sequential, is somewhat besides the point. My focus instead is on presenting the version of myself that will best be able to tackle the not unsubstantial challenges I'll face during the next three months. Already, I find myself lacking in certain respects when it comes to my approach to Phase 0 material. I find myself going through and cherry-picking what I consider to be the easy material and leaving the most difficult material until later. Later on, when all of the low-hanging challenges have been picked so to say, I find my progress frustrated by a series of difficult tasks that completely blunt any mental momentum I may have built up before.</p>

				<p>I need to become better disciplined at tackling my tasks by their conceptual groupings rather than based on easy of completion. This ties in very well with the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset. I need to start facing difficult tasks head-on and embrace these difficult tasks exertions worth struggling over, rather than avoiding them and putting them off indefinitely. I need to accept failures less as validation of inadequacies and more as learning experiences that at the very least leave me no worse for the wear</p>
